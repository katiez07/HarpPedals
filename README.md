Adding Harp Pedals to Sheet Music
Emerging Scholars research project


next steps:

2. also check that it matches the key sig
3. don't display the pedals on top of each other




Known Bugs:
1. doesn't space the pedals out, so many accidentals at once in the music might create unplayableness
2. doesn't highlight unplayable stuff in red
3. doesn't do enharmonics
