Adding Harp Pedals to Sheet Music
Emerging Scholars research project


Possible Additions:
1. modify so it does both clefs at once (now only does 1 clef at a time)
2. space the pedals out, so many accidentals at once in the music doesn't create unplayableness
3. highlight unplayable stuff in red
4. do enharmonics
